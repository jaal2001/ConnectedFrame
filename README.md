# Picture Frame

This project is a fork from: https://github.com/fvdbosch/ConnectedFrame

The original project did contain dropbox and a voting feature, which was not needed by my project. So I stripped all not needed features, which gave the pictures some more room on the screen.

I'm using https://github.com/gilesknap/gphotos-sync for downloading the pictures to the frame. According to the change rate, it could be sufficient to run the photos sync once a week. gphotos-sync allows to skip videos for download, which is a huge benefit for the picture frame.

One of the next steps would be to update the application to enable videos also.
